# ESII - Engenharia de Software II

This is an evaluation project of the ESII curricular unit.

## Description

Hotel H2U, over the course of 3 years of activity, has extensive information on the behavior of its customers with regard to service acquisition practices, as well as geographic and demographic information.

The Hotel manager (H2U) would like to better understand the different profiles of its customers in order to develop more efficient and targeted marketing strategies, namely:

- Who are the best customers
- Who are the most loyal customers
- Who are the customers you should retain or which customers you should pay more or less attention to

## Technologies

Hotel H2U Guest Rating uses several open-source projects to work properly:

- [Java](https://www.java.com/) - Main programming language
- [IntelliJ IDEA](https://www.jetbrains.com/idea/) - IDE for developing software written in Java, Kotlin, Groovy, and other JVM-based languages
- [PMD](https://pmd.github.io/) - Source code analyzer that reports issues found in application code
- [JUnit](https://junit.org/) - Framework for creating unit tests
- [JaCoCo](https://www.jacoco.org/) - Toolkit for measuring code coverage and reporting it
- [Microsoft Word](https://www.microsoft.com/pt-pt/microsoft-365/word/) - Document creation and word processing
- [Discord](https://discord.com/) - Application for voice, video, and text conversation

And of course, Hotel H2U Guest Rating itself is open source with a [public repository](https://github.com/WallQ/ESII) on GitHub.
